This can be played through Sonic Pi. I downloaded the software to get started on makning music. 

I ended up playing around with some alread set songs in Sonic Pi and playing aroudn with random percussion sounds and melodies. 
I found out I can use a triangle or a wood block as a sound. With this I wanted to make a minecraft song mimicing mining but that wasn't going the best.

I decided to make an ambient song and wanted it to have an intro, middle, end or atleast some variation in between. 
Thats why i use random sleep sections throughout the code.
