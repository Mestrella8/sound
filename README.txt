This can be played through Sonic Pi. I downloaded the software to get started on makning music. 

I ended up playing around with some already set songs in Sonic Pi and playing around with random percussion sounds and melodies. 
I learned I can use a triangle or a wood block as a sound. With this, I wanted to make a Minecraft song mimicking mining but that 
wasn't the best. I decided to make an ambient song and wanted an intro, middle, end or at least some variation. Thats why I use 
random sleep sections throughout the code.
